 * This application will have 5 classes in
 * total ( including main ). One class is a deque. It is a
 * double ended queue where both insertion and delection is
 * possible from both end. So, with the help of deque I have
 * crete stack and queue class.
 * There is one more class which is a customer class that
 * helps us to crete a deck of a customer. 
 * So, wee will
 * provide 3 option
 * for user. Option one will provide the option to the
 * user where they can manipulate queue, stack and deque as
 * per their needs.
 * Option two is a game "Top Trump" and option three
 * contains the option to exit the program.
