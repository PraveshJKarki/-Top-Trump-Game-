# "Top Trump Game"
This application will have 5 classes in  total ( including main ). One class is a deque. It is a double ended queue where both insertion and delection is
possible from both end. So, with the help of deque I have create stack and queue class. There is one more class which is a customer class that
helps us to crete a deck of a customer. So, wee will provide 3 option for the user. Option one will provide the option to the user where they can manipulate queue, stack and deque as per their needs. Option two is a game "Top Trump" and option three contains the option to exit the program.

Here are some of the sample of running the program. 


<*************** This is the welcome page which shows three different options to choose from. *******************************>
